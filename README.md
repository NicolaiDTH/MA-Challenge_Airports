Maker's Academy - Airport Challenge
--
Following our first week of object oriented development, a challenge appeared! We had been learning this style of coding by getting to grips with an exercise called 'Boris Bikes'. This weekend's task however included a slightly more complex set of requirements to create a functioning airport!


Instructions:
--
Not an interactive application - run in rspec in the right directory to see the tests pass!


Lessons Learned:
--
* Better understanding of object oriented development.
* Test driven developing pushing the editing process.
* Raising errors where necessary.
* More array interaction and learning.
* Attribute accessors and modules used successfully.


Problems With The Code:
--
* Challenge partially incomplete - queues not mastered.
* Language and naming proved difficult for human translation.
* Individual efforts more trying than group/pairing.
* TDD used as a tidying tool rather than a building one.
